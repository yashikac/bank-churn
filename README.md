# Credit Card Users Churn Prediction
### Problem Statement
### Business Context
The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

You as a Data scientist at Thera bank need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards

What Is a Revolving Balance?
If we don't pay the balance of the revolving credit account in full every month, the unpaid portion carries over to the next month. That's called a revolving balance
What is the Average Open to buy?
'Open to Buy' means the amount left on your credit card to use. Now, this column represents the average of this value for the last 12 months.
What is the Average utilization Ratio?
The Avg_Utilization_Ratio represents how much of the available credit the customer spent. This is useful for calculating credit scores.
Relation b/w Avg_Open_To_Buy, Credit_Limit and Avg_Utilization_Ratio:
( Avg_Open_To_Buy / Credit_Limit ) + Avg_Utilization_Ratio = 1
